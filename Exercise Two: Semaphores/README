You will need the following files to complete this lab:
	Semaphore.h - The header file for the Semaphore class. This file is provided for your use. 
			Make sure you understand how it works.
			
	Semaphore.cpp - The implementation file for the Semaphore class. This file is provided for your
			use. Make sure you understand how it works.
			
	main.cpp - The file containing the main function. This main function must create at least two	
			threads where one thread signals the other using a common Semaphore. In this
			lab this is where all your code will go.
			
	Makefile - This is the project file. It contains rules that tell the system how to compile the
			code and produce a working executable called signal.
			
	Doxyfile - This file contains the settings for the Doxygen tool. It is generated by the doxygen
			program when run for the first time.
			
	README - This is a text file describing the project. Every project must have one
	
	
TASKS

	1) Edit the main.cpp(or signal.cpp) file so that the two functions (taskOne and taskTwo) are
		 run in seperate threads and a semaphore is used to ensure that taskOne runs and exits 
		 before taskTwo.
	
	2) All the code you produce must be properly commented using Doxygen, compile witout error and 	
		be correct.
